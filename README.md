# ATC Now!
The Service will allow the trainers and injured athletes to make appointments, directly message each other through the app, and it will provide each athletes’ exercises (possibly with a checklist feature?) 
## Architecture
Will need both a client (iPhone app) and database. Wondering if this is too ambitious… We would need this-or some other way-to store the data and it would have to persist across users. 
## Challenges
Lots of features, so figuring how to get each piece running with the others. Also the database-- figuring out how to store all the data (athletes and trainers, athlete exercises, athlete appointments, communications, etc.)
